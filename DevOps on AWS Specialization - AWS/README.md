# Syllabus

## Course 1: AWS Cloud Technical Essentials

AWS Cloud Technical Essentials is a fundamental-level course and will build your competence, confidence, and credibility with practical cloud skills that help you innovate and advance your professional future. Enroll in AWS Cloud Technical Essentials and start learning the technical fundamentals of AWS today!

**Week 1**

In this week, you will learn the definition of cloud computing and how to describe the cloud value proposition. You will learn how to differentiate between workloads that run on-premises versus in the cloud, and how to create an AWS account. You will also get an overview of Amazon Web Services, including how to differentiate between AWS Regions and Availability Zones, and the different ways that you can interact with AWS. Finally, you will learn best practices for using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

**Week 2**

Welcome to Week 2, where you will learn how AWS compute services differ from other AWS services. The content for this week covers the basic components of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) architecture, and how to differentiate between a container and a virtual machine. You will also learn about the features and advantages of using serverless technologies, basic networking concepts, and the features of Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

**Week 3**

This week, you will learn important concepts for AWS storage services—such as buckets and objects for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and how Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is used on AWS. You will also explore databases on AWS, and the use cases for each AWS storage service.

**Week 4**

Welcome to Week 4, where you will learn about the benefits of monitoring on AWS, and how to optimize solutions on AWS. You will also learn about the function of Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), and how to differentiate between vertical scaling and horizontal scaling.


## Course 2: Code, Build, and Test

DevOps process can be visualized as an infinite loop, comprising these steps: plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor. Throughout each phase, teams collaborate and communicate to maintain alignment, velocity, and quality. This course in the DevOps on AWS specialization focuses on code, build and test parts of the workflow. We will discuss topics such as source control, best practices for Continuous Integration, and how to use the right tools to measure code quality, by identifying workflow steps that could be automated.

**Week 1**

This week, you will be introduced to DevOps cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that you can use to deliver applications and services faster and at a higher quality. Building off this knowledge, you will get hands-on with AWS services, such as AWS Cloud9, by setting up a development environment for a sample application.

**Week 2**

In the second week, you will discover why it’s important for teams to incorporate testing into the software development lifecycle at different stages of the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. You will get hands-on with AWS solutions by performing various application tests with AWS CodeBuild, automate your release process with AWS CodePipeline, and automate code deployments with AWS CodeDeploy.


## Course 3: Release and Deploy

The third course in the series explains how to improve the deployment process with DevOps methodology, and also some tools that might make deployments easier, such as Infrastructure as Code, or IaC, and AWS CodeDeploy.

The course begins with reviewing topics covered in the first course of the DevOps on AWS series. You will learn about the differences between continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. In Exercises 1 and 2, you will set up AWS CodeDeploy and make revisions that will then be deployed. If you use AWS Lambda, you will explore ways to address additional considerations when you deploy updates to your Lambda functions.

Next, you will explore how infrastructure as code (IaC) helps organizations achieve automation, and which AWS solutions provide a DevOps-focused way of creating and maintaining infrastructure. In Exercise 3, you will be provided with an AWS CloudFormation template that will set up backend services, such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodeBuild. You will then upload new revisions to the pipeline.

**Week 1**

This week, you will start by reviewing topics covered in the first course of the DevOps on AWS series. You will learn about the differences between continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. In Exercises 1 and 2, you will set up AWS CodeDeploy and make revisions that will then be deployed. If you use AWS Lambda, you will explore ways to address additional considerations when you deploy updates to your Lambda functions. Lastly, you will end the week by discovering ways to troubleshoot deployment errors.

**Week 2**

This week, you will explore how infrastructure as code (IaC) helps organizations achieve automation, and which AWS solutions provide a DevOps-focused way of creating and maintaining infrastructure. In Exercise 3, you will be provided with an AWS CloudFormation template that will set up backend services, such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeDeploy, and AWS CodeBuild. You will then upload new revisions to the pipeline.


## Course 4: Operate and Monitor

The third and the final course in the DevOps series will teach how to use AWS Services to control the architecture in order to reach a better operational state. Monitoring and Operation are key aspects for both the release pipeline and production environments, because they provide instruments that help discover what's happening, as well as do modifications and enhancements on infrastructure that is currently running. 

This course teaches how to use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring, as well as Amazon EventBridge and AWS Config for continuous compliance. It also covers Amazon CloudTrail and a little bit of Machine Learning for Monitoring operations!

**Week 1**

This week, you will start by reviewing topics covered in the first and second courses of the DevOps on AWS series. You will then learn about the importance of monitoring and why instrumenting your environment is helpful. You will explore how Amazon CloudWatch provides you with data and actionable insights to monitor your applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health. Lastly, you will get hands-on with other important AWS solutions to monitor pipeline changes.

**Week 2**

This week, you will start by learning about the importance of operation in continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines and discover how to detect unmanaged configuration changes to your cloud resources. Though this course focused on AWS solutions for DevOps operations and monitoring, you will also learn about third-party, open-source tooling that are well-known and widely used by the DevOps community. Lastly, you will get hands-on and run commands using AWS Systems Manager, and output logs to Amazon CloudWatch.
